This directory contains a collection of scripts written by Pizza.py
users that are generically useful; you may wish to use them directly
or modify them for your own purposes.  You can add your own scripts to
this directory as well.

Any script in this directory (or other directories you define, see the
Pizza.py manual), can be run from Pizza.py, by typing a line
appropriate to the script's syntax, e.g.

% pizza.py -f movie.py svg 0.5 60 135 dump.*          from the shell
> @run movie.py svg 0.5 60 135 dump.*                 from Pizza.py

The top of each script file describes its purpose and syntax.  That
information can be be accessed from within Pizza.py by typing "??" or
"? name.py" or "?? name.py".

Many of the scripts can also be run directly from Python (without
running Pizza.py), so long as the Pizza.py tools (Python files) it
needs to import (e.g. log.py) can be found by Python.
