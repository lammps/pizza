<H3>gnu tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Create plots via GnuPlot plotting program.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The gnu tool is a wrapper on the <A HREF = "http://www.gnuplot.info/">GnuPlot</A>
plotting package.  GnuPlot is open source software and runs on any
platform.
</P>
<P>The gnu constructor launches GnuPlot as a process which the gnu tool
sends commands to.  The GnuPlot process can be killed via the stop()
method, though this is typically unnecessary.
</P>
<P>The plot() method plots a single vector against a linear index or
pairs of vectors against each other.  The pairs of vectors are written
to files and read-in by GnuPlot's plot command.
</P>
<P>The mplot() method creates a series of plots and saves them each to a
numbered file.  Each file is a plot of an increasing portion of the
vector(s).  This can be used to make an animation of a plot.
</P>
<P>The enter() method can be used to interact with GnuPlot directly.
Each subsequent line you type is a GnuPlot command, until you type
"quit" or "exit" to return to Pizza.py.  Single GnuPlot commands can
be issued as string arguments to the gnu tool.
</P>
<P>The export() method writes numeric data as columns to text files, so
that GnuPlot can read them via its "plot" command.
</P>
<P>Mutliple windows can be displayed, plotted to, and manipulated using
the select() and hide() methods.  The save() method writes the
currently selected plot to a PostScript file.
</P>
<P>The remaining methods (aspect, title, xrange, etc) set attributes of
the currently selected plot.  The erase() method resets all attributes
to their default values.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>g = gnu()		       start up GnuPlot
g.stop()		       shut down GnuPlot process 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.plot(a)                      plot vector A against linear index
g.plot(a,b)	 	       plot B against A
g.plot(a,b,c,d,...)	       plot B against A, D against C, etc
g.mplot(M,N,S,"file",a,b,...)  multiple plots saved to file0000.eps, etc 
</PRE>
<PRE>  each plot argument can be a tuple, list, or Numeric/NumPy vector
  mplot loops over range(M,N,S) and create one plot per iteration
    last args are same as list of vectors for plot(), e.g. 1, 2, 4 vectors
    each plot is made from a portion of the vectors, depending on loop index i
      Ith plot is of b[0:i] vs a[0:i], etc
    series of plots saved as file0000.eps, file0001.eps, etc
    if use xrange(),yrange() then plot axes will be same for all plots 
</PRE>
<PRE>g("plot 'file.dat' using 2:3 with lines")      execute string in GnuPlot 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.enter()	   	                enter GnuPlot shell
gnuplot> plot sin(x) with lines         type commands directly to GnuPlot
gnuplot> exit, quit	      	        exit GnuPlot shell 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.export("data",range(100),a,...)       create file with columns of numbers 
</PRE>
<PRE>  all vectors must be of equal length
  could plot from file with GnuPlot command: plot 'data' using 1:2 with lines 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.select(N)  	               figure N becomes the current plot 
</PRE>
<PRE>  subsequent commands apply to this plot 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.hide(N)  	               delete window for figure N
g.save("file")	               save current plot as file.eps 
</PRE>
<PRE>Set attributes for current plot: 
</PRE>
<PRE>g.erase()                      reset all attributes to default values
g.aspect(1.3)                  aspect ratio
g.xtitle("Time")               x axis text
g.ytitle("Energy")             y axis text
g.title("My Plot")             title text
g.title("title","x","y")       title, x axis, y axis text
g.xrange(xmin,xmax)            x axis range
g.xrange()                     default x axis range
g.yrange(ymin,ymax)            y axis range
g.yrange()                     default y axis range
g.xlog()                       toggle x axis between linear and log
g.ylog()                       toggle y axis between linear and log
g.label(x,y,"text")            place label at x,y coords
g.curve(N,'r')                 set color of curve N 
</PRE>
<PRE>  colors: 'k' = black, 'r' = red, 'g' = green, 'b' = blue
          'm' = magenta, 'c' = cyan, 'y' = yellow
