vcr tool :h3

[Purpose:]

VCR-style GUI for 3d interactive OpenGL visualization.

[Description:]

The vcr tool displays a GUI to do 3d interactive visualization of
LAMMPS snapshots or data files.  It is a wrapper on the "gl"_gl.html
tool which draws the individual images in OpenGL windows

The vcr constructor creates the GUI.  Note that multiple OpenGL
windows can be run by the same GUI so that multiple views of the same
data set can be manipulated simultaneously (or views of different data
sets so long as they have the same # of snapshots).

The view can be controlled by the GUI widgets or by invoking the tool
methods: play(), stop(), axis(), etc.  The frame slider can be dragged
to view a desired frame.  The mouse can also be used in the OpenGL
window to translage, rotate, or zoom the scene.  The clipping sliders
or methods can be used to narrow the view of displayed data, though
their interactivity can be slow for scenes with lots of data.

The reload() method is needed if you change the selection attributes
of the underlying data assigned to the "gl"_gl.html tool, such as via
the "dump"_dump.html tool's methods.  These changes will not be
visible in the OpenGL windows until the data is reloaded.

The save() method will save the current OpenGL window contents
to a PNG file.  If multiple OpenGL windows are being used, multiple
files will be created.  The save-all checkbox or method will store one
file per snapshot if the Play or Back buttons are used to start an
animation.

[Usage:]

v = vcr(gl1,gl2,...)       start vcr GUI with one or more gl windows
v.add(gl)                  add a gl window to vcr GUI :pre

Actions (same as GUI widgets): :pre

v.first()		   go to first frame
v.prev()                   go to previous frame
v.back()                   play backwards from current frame to start
v.stop()         	   stop on current frame		
v.play()                   play from current frame to end
v.next()		   go to next frame
v.last()		   go to last frame :pre

v.frame(31)    	           set frame slider
v.delay(0.4)     	   set delay slider
v.q(5)          	   set quality slider :pre

v.xaxis()		   view scene from x axis
v.yaxis()  		   view scene from y axis
v.zaxis()		   view scene from z axis
v.box()		 	   toggle bounding box
v.axis() 	           toggle display of xyz axes
v.norm()	           recenter and resize the view
v.ortho()	           toggle ortho/perspective button
v.reload()           	   reload all frames from gl viewer data files :pre

v.clipxlo(0.2)             clip scene at x lo fraction of box
v.clipxhi(1.0)             clip at x hi
v.clipylo(0.2)             clip in y
v.clipyhi(1.0)
v.clipzlo(0.2)             clip in z
v.clipzhi(1.0) :pre

v.save()		   save current scene to file.png
v.file("image")		   set filename
v.saveall()		   toggle save-all checkbox :pre
