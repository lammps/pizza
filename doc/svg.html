<H3>svg tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>3d visualization via SVG files.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The svg tool creates Scalable Vector Graphics
(<A HREF = "http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG">SVG</A>) files from atom or mesh
snapshots.  The SVG format can be displayed or animated by various
tools and is a popular format for viewing solid state lattices.
</P>
<P>The svg constructor takes a data object containing atom or mesh
snapshots as an argument (<A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A>, <A HREF = "data.html">data</A>,
<A HREF = "cdata.html">cdata</A>, <A HREF = "mdump.html">mdump</A>).
</P>
<P>The show() method creates an image.svg file for snapshot N.  The all()
method loops thru all selected snapshots and creates the image files
image0000.svg, image0001.svg, etc.  The prefix "image" can be changed
via the file setting.
</P>
<P>The bg(), size(), rotate(), trans(), zoom(), box(), label(), and
nolabel() methods control various aspects of the images produced.
Without the trans() and zoom() settings, the Raster3d image should
roughly fill the window and be centered.
</P>
<P>Additional movie effects can be produced using the pan() and select()
methods.  The pan() method specifies an initial and final viewpoint
that is applied to the images produced by the all() method.  For
intermediate images, the view parameters will be interpolated between
their initial and final values.  The pan() method can thus be used to
rotate a single image or fly-by the simulation as it animates.  The
select() method performs additional atom selection for each image of
the all() sequence.  An image-dependent %g variable can be used in the
select() string.  The select() method can thus be used to slice thru
the data set.
</P>
<P>The acol(), arad(), bcol(), brad(), and tcol() methods change
attributes of the atoms, bonds, and triangles displayed.  Each atom or
bond returned from the data object has an integer "type" from 1 to N.
The type is used to index into a list of RGB colors or radii for atoms
and bond thickness.  The adef(), bdef(), and tdef() methods setup
default mappings of types to colors/radii.  The other methods enable
specific assignments to be made.  The interpolation option (e.g. many
types assigned to a few colors), enables a smooth rainbow of colors to
be assigned to a range of types.  Note that the <A HREF = "dump.html">dump</A> tool
allows any vector to be returned as an atom "type" via its atype
setting.  Thus displayed colors can be keyed to atom velocity or other
properties.
</P>
<P>Colors are specified with a string, e.g. "red".  There are 140
pre-defined colors from <A HREF = "http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/wdnut/excerpt/color_names.html">this WWW page</A> which can be
examined by importing the "colors" variable from "vizinfo".  New
colors can be defined by assigning a nickname of your choice to an RGB
triplet, as described below.

s.size(N,M)		    set image size to NxM
s.rotate(60,135)            view from z theta and azimuthal phi (def = 60,30)

</PRE>
<PRE>s.show(N)                   show image of snapshot at timestep N 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.all()                     make images of all selected snapshots

s.all(N,M,P)                make M images of snapshot N, start label at P 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.pan(60,135,1.0,40,135,1.5)    pan during all() operation

</PRE>

  size = fontsize (e.g. 10), "red" = color of text 
</PRE>
<PRE>s.acol(2,"green")		   set atom colors by atom type (1-N)

s.acol(range(10),"loop")           assign colors in loop, randomly ordered 
</PRE>
<PRE>  if 1st arg is 0, set all types to 2nd arg
  if list of types has a 0 (e.g. range(10)), +1 is added to each value
  interpolate means colors blend smoothly from one value to the next
