plotview tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Plot multiple vectors from a data set.

[Description:]

The plotview tool displays a GUI for showing a series of plots of
vectors stored in another Pizza.py tool.  Individual plots can be
displayed or hidden or saved to a file.

The plotview constructor creates the GUI and takes a data object
("log"_log.html, "vec"_vec.html) and a plot object ("gnu"_gnu.html,
"matlab"_matlab.html) as arguments.

The vectors in the data object are converted to individual plots.  The
2nd thru Nth vectors are each plotted against the 1st vector to create
N-1 plots.  One or more plots can be displayed simultaneously (right
buttons in GUI), but only one is selected at a time (left buttons in
GUI).  The yes(), no(), and select() methods perform the same function
as the GUI buttons.

The currently selected plot can be modified (title, range, etc)
by the methods of the plot object.

The file() and save() methods (or corresponding GUI widgets) save the
currently selected plot to a PostScript file.

[Usage:]

p = plotview(d,pl)      create GUI for viewing plots :pre

  d = Pizza.py object that contains vectors (log, vec)
  pl = Pizza.py plotting object (gnu, matlab) :pre

p.select(2)             select one plot as current (1-N)
p.yes(3)                toggle one plot's visibility
p.no(3) :pre

  only one plot is selected at a time
  multiple plots can be visible at same time
  select is same as clicking on left-side radio-button
  yes/no is same as clicking on right-side checkbox :pre

p.x = "Time"            which vector is X vector (1st vec by default)
p.file("pressure")      filename prefix for saving a plot
p.save()                save currently selected plot to file.eps :pre
