histo tool :h3

[Purpose:]

Particle density histogram from a dump.

[Description:]

The histo tool creates spatial histograms of particle snapshots in
a dump file.

The histo constructor takes an object that stores atom snapshots
("dump"_dump.html, "data"_data.html) as its argument.

The compute() method creates a histogram in a specific dimension at a
desired resolution, averaged across all selected snapshots and atoms
in the dump.  The returned vectors can be plotted; x is the distance
along the chosen dimension, y is the histogram counts.

[Usage:]

h = histo(d)                        d = dump/cdump object :pre

x,y = h.compute('x',N,lo,hi)        compute histogram in dim with N bins :pre

  lo/hi are optional, if not used histo will be over entire box :pre
