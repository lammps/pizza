<H3>plotview tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>Plot multiple vectors from a data set.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The plotview tool displays a GUI for showing a series of plots of
vectors stored in another Pizza.py tool.  Individual plots can be
displayed or hidden or saved to a file.
</P>
<P>The plotview constructor creates the GUI and takes a data object
(<A HREF = "log.html">log</A>, <A HREF = "vec.html">vec</A>) and a plot object (<A HREF = "gnu.html">gnu</A>,
<A HREF = "matlab.html">matlab</A>) as arguments.
</P>
<P>The vectors in the data object are converted to individual plots.  The
2nd thru Nth vectors are each plotted against the 1st vector to create
N-1 plots.  One or more plots can be displayed simultaneously (right
buttons in GUI), but only one is selected at a time (left buttons in
GUI).  The yes(), no(), and select() methods perform the same function
as the GUI buttons.
</P>
<P>The currently selected plot can be modified (title, range, etc)
by the methods of the plot object.
</P>
<P>The file() and save() methods (or corresponding GUI widgets) save the
currently selected plot to a PostScript file.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>p = plotview(d,pl)      create GUI for viewing plots 
</PRE>
<PRE>  d = Pizza.py object that contains vectors (log, vec)
  pl = Pizza.py plotting object (gnu, matlab) 
</PRE>
<PRE>p.select(2)             select one plot as current (1-N)
p.yes(3)                toggle one plot's visibility
p.no(3) 
</PRE>
<PRE>  only one plot is selected at a time
  multiple plots can be visible at same time
  select is same as clicking on left-side radio-button
  yes/no is same as clicking on right-side checkbox 
</PRE>
<PRE>p.x = "Time"            which vector is X vector (1st vec by default)
p.file("pressure")      filename prefix for saving a plot
p.save()                save currently selected plot to file.eps
