<H3>image tool 
</H3>
<P><B>Purpose:</B>
</P>
<P>View and manipulate images.
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>The image tool can be used to display image files or convert them to
other formats via the ImageMagick tools (or alternate tools if
specified in the DEFAULTS.py file).
</P>
<P>The image constructor creates a GUI to view a set of image files as a
palette of thumbnail-size images.  Each thumbnail can be clicked on to
view the full-size image.  Clicking on the full-size image removes it.
The view() method does the same operation for a new set of files.
</P>
<P>The convert() method invokes the ImageMagick "convert" command to
convert an image file to a different format.  If both arguments have a
wildcard character, one conversion is done for each file in the 1st
argument to create a file in the 2nd argument, e.g. "convert
image0012.svg new0012.png".  If either argument has no wildcard, one
"convert" command is issued using both arguments.  This form can be
used to create a movie file, e.g. "convert *.png ligand.mpg".
</P>
<P>The montage() method invokes the ImageMagick "montage" command to
combine 2 image files to create a 3rd.  If all 3 arguments have a
wildcard character, one montage is created for each file in the 1st
argument, paired with one file in the 2nd argument, e.g. "montage
image0012.svg plot0012.eps combine0012.png".  For this to work, the
1st arguments must each expand to the same number of files.  If any of
the 3 arguments does not have a wildcard, one "montage" command is
issued using all 3 arguements.
</P>
<P>Image files can be in any format (PNG, GIF, JPG, etc) recognized by
the Python Image Library (PIL) installed in your Python or by
ImageMagick.  Various Pizza.py visualization tools (raster, deja,
rasmol, etc) create such image files.  If a particular image format
fails to load, your PIL installation was linked without support for
that format.  Rebuild PIL, and follow the install instructions
included in its top directory.
</P>
<P><B>Usage:</B>
</P>
<PRE>i = image("my1.gif my2.gif")    display thumbnails of matching images
i = image("*.png *.gif")        wildcards allowed
i = image("*.png *.gif",0)      2nd arg = sort filenames, 0 = no sort, def = 1
i = image("")	   		blank string matches all image suffixes
i = image()			no display window opened if no arg 
</PRE>
<PRE>  image suffixes for blank string = *.png, *.bmp, *.gif, *.tiff, *.tif
  click on a thumbnail to view it full-size
  click on thumbnail again to remove full-sized version 
</PRE>
<PRE>i.view("*.png *.gif")	        display thumbnails of matching images 
</PRE>
<PRE>  view arg is same as constructor arg 
</PRE>
<PRE>i.convert("image*.svg","new*.png")                      each SVG file to PNG
i.convert("image*.svg","new*.jpg","-quality 50")        3rd arg is switch
i.convert("image*.png","movie.mpg")                     all PNGs to MPG movie
i.convert("image*.png","movie.mpg","-resize 128x128")   3rd arg is switch
i.montage("","image*.png","plot*.png","two*.png")       image + plot = two
i.montage("-geometry 512x512","i*.png","new.png")       1st arg is switch 
</PRE>
<PRE>  convert with 2 wildcard args loops over 1st set of files to make 2nd set
  convert with not all wildcard args will issue single convert command
  montage with all wildcard args loops over 1st set of files,
    combines with one file from other sets, to make last set of files
  montage with not all wildcard args will issue single montage command
