Pizza.py is a loosely integrated collection of tools written in
Python, many of which provide pre- and post-processing capability for
the LAMMPS molecular dynamics package.  There are tools to create
input files, convert between file formats, process log and dump files,
create plots, and visualize and animate simulation snapshots.

Pizza.py was developed at Sandia National Laboratories, a US
Department of Energy facility, with funding from the DOE.  It is an
open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the GNU Public
License (GPL).

The maintainer of Pizza.py is Steve Plimpton, who can be emailed at
sjplimp@sandia.gov.  The Pizza.py [WWW site](https://pizza.sandia.gov/)
and LAMMPS [WWW Site](https://lammps.sandia.gov/)
have more information about
the code and its uses.
