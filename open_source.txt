Here is a summary of what the GPL means for Pizza.py users:

(1) Anyone is free to use, modify, or extend Pizza.py in any way they
choose, including for commercial purposes.

(2) If you distribute a modified version of Pizza.py, it must remain
open-source, meaning you distribute it under the terms of the GPL.
You should clearly annotate such a code as a derivative version of
Pizza.py.

(3) If you release any code that includes Pizza.py source code, then
it must also be open-sourced, meaning you distribute it under the
terms of the GPL.

(4) If you give Pizza.py files to someone else, the GPL LICENSE file
and source file headers (including the copyright and GPL notices)
should remain part of the code.
